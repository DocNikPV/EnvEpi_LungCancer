# Environmental Epidemiology Seminar Work

This repository contains my MPH (Biostatistics) student **seminar work project** in **Environmental Epidemiology** at the University of Haifa.

The project title: **Positive genetic markers combined with air pollution exposure in the development of lung cancer in the Haifa District cohorts of different ethnic origin**.

The project combines a **critical literature review** with **aggregated laboratory–clinical data** and **regional air pollution data** to explore gene–environment interactions in lung cancer in the Haifa District.

## Seminar work proposal"

### Structure

This seminar work will follow a **hybrid format** consisting of two main parts:

1. **Theoretical part:**

   - Critical review of international and Israeli literature on **gene–environment interactions** in lung cancer, focusing on air pollution exposure and selected genetic mutations.

2. **Practical part:**

   A. **Environmental exposure data:**

   - Compilation and summary of **recent concrete data** on air pollution in the Haifa District.
   - Geographic breakdown by subregions.
   - Sources: **Governmental reports** (e.g., Ministry of Environmental Protection) and **Israeli epidemiological studies**.

   B. **Laboratory–clinical data:**

   - Use of **aggregated, anonymized data** from the Department of Pathology, Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center, Haifa.
   - Identification of **genetic mutations** in lung tissue samples from histopathologically confirmed lung cancer cases.
   - **Genes of interest:** EGFR, BRAF, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, RET (all via NGS), and PD-L1 (via IHC).
   - Mapping of patients’ **residential locations** (city/town/village within the Haifa District).
   - Categorization of **ethnic origin** (dichotomized as “Arab vs. Jewish”).

---

### Cross-synthesis

- **Overlay of pollution data with patient residence data** to visualize geographic patterns.
- Assessment of **correlation and tendencies** between exposure levels and mutation-positive cases.
- Exploration of **potential causality** and, if feasible, development of a **basic statistical model** (visualized using R or Python).

---

### Conclusions and recommendations

- Highlighting of **observed tendencies** and implications for **precision screening** and **targeted prevention**.
- Provision of **public health recommendations** for Israel.
- Emphasis on the need for **integrated genomic–environmental surveillance systems**.

---

### Ethical considerations

- Only **aggregated, anonymized data** will be used.
- No identifiable patient information will be analyzed.
- **IRB approval** (Helsinki Committee) is not required.

# PART III. DATA ANALYSIS

To address both descriptive and inferential aspects of the study, a
**mixed-tool analytical workflow** was employed:

-   ***Excel*** (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA): for descriptive
    statistical analysis and visualization. Raw clinical–laboratory
    data were managed and summarized in tabular form, with
    frequencies, percentages, and basic descriptive plots (bar charts,
    boxplots, histograms) generated to characterize the study cohort
    and its subgroups.

-   ***SAS*** (***Statistical Analysis System***; SAS Institute, Cary,
    NC, USA): a procedural statistical programming language, which was
    used for inferential analyses. The cloud-based ***SAS OnDemand for
    Academics (SODA)*** platform served as the execution environment,
    enabling cross-tabulations with χ² and Fisher’s exact tests,
    correlation analyses, and geographic association tests to quantify
    relationships between clinical variables, histological diagnoses,
    and exposure categories.

-   ***Power BI*** (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) was employed for
    geospatial visualization and exploratory clustering. Patient
    localities were mapped as weighted points (by number of cases) and
    stratified interactively by histological type and clinical
    variables. This approach enabled the identification of geographic
    tendencies in case distribution and facilitated visual comparison
    with pollution exposure areas.

This integrated approach ensured that descriptive patterns were
clearly presented, inferential associations were rigorously tested,
and geographic tendencies were visualized in relation to environmental
exposures.

# Chapter 3.1. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE (AIR POLLUTION) DATA

> > > Where you can get Israeli air quality data?\*\*

-   Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection (המשרד להגנת הסביבה):
    air quality monitoring network across the country -
    https://www.svivaaqm.net/. You can view and download data (SO₂,
    NOₓ, PM₂.₅, O₃, etc.) by station and by date.

-   Open Data Portal – Israel Government (data.gov.il). Search for
    "air quality" or "environmental monitoring".

-   Scientific publications / Haifa studies: many academic works
    (including those cited in your lecture slides) used these
    monitoring station datasets. Some include supplemental data with
    station coordinates.

> > > What you’d get:

-   Station locations (latitude/longitude, name, district).

-   Pollutant concentrations (hourly/daily averages of SO₂, NOₓ,
    PM₂.₅, etc.).

-   Sometimes long-term averages (multi-year trends).

> > > Task:

You don’t need to reconstruct the full monitoring network; even
summary station maps + average pollutant levels are enough to
demonstrate pollution distribution in Haifa Bay vs surrounding areas.

# Chapter 3.2. CLINICAL-LABORATORY DATA (LUNG CANCER DIAGNOSIS)

## Background

> > > Short description of problem/context.

## Objectives

-   Identification of genetic mutations in lung tissue samples from
    histopathologically confirmed lung cancer cases. **Genes of
    interest**: PD-L1 (via IHC); MET, EGFR, BRAF, KRAS, ERBB2, ALK,
    ROS1, NTRK1/NTRK2/NTRK3, RET (all via NGS); mismatch repair (MMR)
    genes (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) (via PCR).

-   Mapping of patients’ **residential locations** (city/town/village
    within the Haifa District).

-   Categorization of **ethnic origin**.

## Data source

**Origin**: Individual electronic medical records (EMRs) of patients
(whose lung biopsy and surgical material was diagnosed in the
Department of Pathology of the Carmel Medical Center, Haifa) in the
"Ofek" intra/interhospital medical informatics platform. The
clinical-laboratory variables come from EMR, \[patho\]histology,
immunohistochemistry, and new generation sequencing (NGS) testing and
are used for descriptive and comparative analyses within the cohort.
These patient‑level data was further overlapped with exposure metrics
(Chapter 3.1) to explore associations between ambient air pollution
and tumor characteristics.

**Sample**: 94 lung cancer cases managed at Carmel Medical Center in
2024-2025.

**Dataset (CarmelMC_LungCancer.xlsx)**: created through review of
anonymized electronic medical records of 94 lung cancer patients at
Carmel Medical Center - was uploaded into SAS for statistical
analysis. Twenty-one variables were available, covering demographics
(age, sex, ethnic group, residential district, smoking history),
histopathological diagnosis, and molecular biomarkers (PD-L1
expression, EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, MET, ALK, ROS1, NTRK, RET, ERBB2, MSI,
TMB). For the full raw data set see *Appendix A*.

## Data dictionary (clinical-laboratory variables)

In this study we adopt the SAS convention of variable typing, which
distinguishes only between *numeric* and *character* variables
(syntactical approach). Under this approach, the functional role of a
variable (continuous, discrete count, binary flag, or categorical) is
determined by its analytical use rather than by its storage type.

***id*** (numeric, nominal; identifier, not for analysis) - a clinical
case's anonymized number

***sex*** (numeric, binary) - a patient's biological sex:

```         
0 = male
1 = female
```

***age*** (numeric, continuous) - a patient's age (years) at the date
of the lung biopsy or surgery

***ethnic*** (numeric, nominal) - a patient's presumed ethnic origin
(subjective approximation based on the patient's name/surname
evaluation and locality; not officially confirmed):

```         
0 = Jewish
1 = Arab (not otherwise specified [NOS])
2 = Arab (Druze) 
3 = Arab (Bedouin)   
```

***locality*** (character, nominal): a patient's place of residence
(city, town, village, etc.)

***district*** (numeric, binary): Israeli administrative district to
which a patient's locality belongs:

```         
0 = Haifa District 
1 = Northern District
```

***smoking*** (numeric, binary): a patient's smoking status:

```         
0 = non-smoker - never smoked or quit > 10 years before the lung biopsy/surgery date
1 = smoker - current smoker or quit ≤ 10 years before the lung biopsy/surgery date
```

***bx_date*** (numeric, continuous): date of the lung biopsy or
surgery performed

***dx*** (numeric, nominal): pathohistogical diagnosis of lung cancer:

```         
0 = adenocarcinoma (ACA), NOS 
1 = mucinous ACA (MucACA)
2 = squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
3 = neuroendocrine tumor (NET) - low-grade (typical carcinoid) or intermediate-grade (atypical carcinoid) neuroendocrine neoplasm  
4 = neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) - high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasm (small cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma)  
```

***pdl1*** (numeric, binary): PD-L1 expression measured by tumor
proportion score (TPS):

```         
0 = weak (TPS = 1-49%) 
1 = strong (TPS ≥ 50%)

TPS: the percentage of viable tumor cells that express PD-L1 on their surface:
   
PS = (number of PD-L1-positive tumor cells / total number of viable tumor cells) * 100% 

A sample is considered adequate, when it contains > 100 viable tumor cells. A higher TPS score generally correlates with a better response to immunotherapy, e.g., to pembrolizumab (Keytruda) patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
```

***met*** (numeric, binary): MET gene mutation status:

```         
0 - no mutation 
1 - mutation detected
```

***egfr*** (numeric, binary): EGFR gene mutation status:

```         
0 - no mutation 
1 - mutation detected
```

***braf*** (numeric, binary): BRAF gene mutation status:

```         
0 - no mutation 
1 - mutation detected
```

***kras*** (numeric, binary): KRAS gene mutation status:

```         
0 - no mutation 
1 - mutation detected
```

***erbb2*** (numeric, binary): ERBB2 (HER2) gene mutation status:

```         
0 - no mutation 
1 - mutation detected
```

***alk*** (numeric, binary): ALK gene mutation status:

```         
0 - no mutation 
1 - mutation detected
```

***ros1*** (numeric, binary): ROS1 gene mutation status:

```         
0 - no mutation 
1 - mutation detected 
```

***ntrk*** (numeric, binary): NTRK1/NTRK2/NTRK3 genes mutation status:

```         
0 - no mutation 
1 - mutation detected
```

***ret*** (numeric, binary): RET gene mutation status:

```         
0 - no mutation 
1 - mutation detected
```

***msi*** (numeric, ordinal): microsatellite instability (MSI) status
of the tumor - instability of short tandem repeats of DNA
(***microsatellites***) of the tumor cells, which results from
abnormal function of one or more mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MLH1,
PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6):

```         
0 - microsatellite stable (MSS) status 
1 - low microsatellite instability (MSI-L) 
2 - high microsatellite instability (MSI-H)
```

***tmb*** (numeric, continuous): tumor mutational burden (TMD) (via
NGS) - predictive biomarker.

```         
TMB = number of non-inherited mutations / megabase (million bases, Mb) of the investigated genomic sequence 

TMB is strongly predictive of a patient's response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, of overall as well as disease-specific survival - independently of cancer type, stage or grade.
```

## Data preprocessing

The clinical-laboratory dataset comprised 94 anonymized patient
records, each with a unique identifier. Data completeness was high,
with only 0.6% of values missing overall. Continuous variables,
including age (42–91 years) and tumor mutational burden (0.95–27.1),
were within plausible clinical ranges. Categorical variables (sex,
smoking status, ethnic group, histological diagnosis, and molecular
markers) contained only valid coded values as defined in the data
dictionary. No structural errors or inconsistencies were detected.

The dataset was therefore considered reliable and suitable for
descriptive, inferential, and spatial analyses.

## Methods

-   **Dataset variables and their coding**: Whenever possible,
    categorical nominal and binary variables were coded as dummy
    numbers (0...4 or 0/1). Molecular markers are 0/1 when tested.
    Some markers have missing values (initially not laboratory tested
    due to technical reasons). Wee did not recode missings to 0. TMB
    is continuous (mutations/Mb) and MSI is binary (0/1).

-   **Statistical analysis**: we computed descriptive statistics for
    continuous variables and frequency distributions (%) for
    categorical variables. We also examined selected cross‑tabs (e.g.,
    smoking × dx, smoking × egfr / kras). For 2 × 2 comparisons (EGFR,
    KRAS, PD-L1 vs smoking), Fisher exact test was used where
    appropriate; for histology (4×2 table), Pearson Chi-square was
    applied, as Fisher exact is not available for multi-category
    tables.

The calculations and plotting were performed in Statistical Analytics
System (SAS) programming language whilst using SAS OnDemand for
Academics (SAS Studio) platform. The appropriate SAS code scripts are
provided in the Appendix B.

We used PROC MEANS/UNIVARIATE for continuous variables (age, tmb),
PROC FREQ for categorical distributions, and PROC FREQ with CHI‑SQUARE
and FISHER options for cross‑tabulations (smoking ×
histology/genetics; PD‑L1 × histology). User‑defined PROC FORMAT
labels matched the data dictionary.

The study cohort (*Table 3.2.1*, *Fig. 3.2.1*) consisted of 94 lung
cancer patients. The median age at diagnosis was 72 years (range:
42–91). Slightly more than half of the cohort were male (55.3%), with
females comprising 44.7%. Smoking status was nearly balanced, with
51.1% categorized as non-smokers and 48.9% as smokers.

Geographically, 39.4% of patients resided in the Haifa District, while
60.6% lived in the Northern District. Ethnically, the majority were
Jewish (68.1%), followed by Arab (NOS) patients (25.5%), Druze (5.3%),
and a small proportion of Bedouins (1.1%).

Histopathological diagnoses were dominated by adenocarcinoma (ACA,
NOS) (67.0%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (26.6%),
mucinous ACA (4.3%), and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) (2.1%). No
patients were diagnosed with carcinoid tumors (NET).

Overall, the cohort represents an elderly, balanced male/female
population, predominantly Jewish, with a near-equal split of smokers
vs non-smokers.

+------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+

Interpretation: ACA is the dominant pathohistological diagnosis
(71.28%, including mucinous ACA), followed by SCC. Among the tumors,
42.55% express strong PD-L1, making them immunotherapy-eligible. KRAS
mutations were most common (24.47%), while EGFR occurred in 12.77%,
consistent with Western lung cancer cohorts; BRAF, MET, and ROS1
alterations were rare; ALK, RET, NTRK, and ERBB2 had no mutations. All
cases were microsatellite-stable. TMB distribution was skewed low,
with some high outliers.

### Cross-tabulations and associations

+------------------+------------------+-------------+
| EGFR vs smoking  | 2-sided Fisher   | 0.0037      |
| KRAS vs smoking  | exact 2-sided    | 0.4753      |
| PD-L1 vs smoking | Fisher exact     | 0.8374      |
| Histology vs     | 2-sided Fisher   | 0.2506      |
| smoking          | exact Pearson    |             |
|                  | Chi-square       |             |
+------------------+------------------+-------------+

Interpretation: EGFR mutations were significantly enriched among
non-smokers, consistent with the well-established biological profile
of non-smoking–associated lung ACA. KRAS mutations tended to occur
more often among current/recent smokers, but this pattern did not
reach statistical significance. PD-L1 expression showed no
relationship to smoking. Histological type of the tumor did not differ
by smoking status.

**Conclusion:** Within this cohort, EGFR was the only biomarker
significantly associated with smoking history, while KRAS showed only
a non-significant trend and PD-L1/histology distributions were
independent of smoking.

### Spatial distribution of lung cancer cases

Fig. \[...\] and \[...\] present geographic distribution 94 lung
cancer cases across Northern Israel, aggregated by locality of
residence at the time of diagnosis.

![](output_figures/id-locality_plot.jpeg)
![](output_figures/id-locality_map.jpeg)

Cases were observed in multiple urban and rural settlements, with the
largest concentrations in the Haifa metropolitan area and surrounding
towns. Additional clusters appeared along the coastal plain (e.g.,
Acre, Nahariya) and in inland localities such as Nazareth and Safed.
Peripheral settlements (e.g., Upper Galilee, Golan Subdistrict) showed
relatively few cases.

This descriptive mapping highlights spatial heterogeneity in case
counts, suggesting potential geographic gradients that may warrant
further investigation in relation to environmental exposures.

### Kernel density estimation of lung cancer cases

(KDE) of lung cancer case locations, based on latitude and longitude
coordinates of patients’ localities.

The KDE surface reveals a primary density peak in the western coastal
zone corresponding approximately to the Haifa metropolitan area,
indicating a concentration of cases in this region. Secondary, weaker
density areas appear inland (around Nazareth and the Lower Galilee)
and along the northern coastal plain (Acre–Nahariya). Peripheral
regions, including the Upper Galilee and the Golan Subdistrict, show
negligible density values.

These results reinforce the impression from descriptive mapping that
cases are spatially clustered, with the strongest concentration in the
Haifa Bay area. Such clustering patterns suggest potential links to
regional environmental exposures and warrant further analysis using
formal spatial autocorrelation or cluster detection methods.

Although Pearson’s Chi-square test was initially calculated, 50% of
the table cells had expected counts \< 5, violating Chi-square
assumptions. Therefore, Fisher’s exact test provides the more valid
evaluation of the association between district and histological
subtype.

*Note.* Distribution of histological subtypes across localities is
highly uneven, with many localities contributing only a single case.
Because of the resulting small expected cell counts (\< 5 in most
cells), Pearson’s Chi-square is not a valid test here. Fisher’s exact
test (or collapsing categories into broader groups) is required for
statistical inference, though interpretability remains limited given
the small strata sizes.

**Conclusions**: Our Northern Israel lung cancer study cohort is
characterized by ACA predominance, balanced smoking distribution, and
a mutation spectrum typical for Western populations. EGFR and KRAS
show opposite enrichment patterns by smoking history, consistent with
established biology. PD-L1 expression is high in 42.55% of tumors,
underscoring an immunotherapy-eligible subset. These
clinical-molecular patterns provide the foundation for linking to the
environmental exposures (air pollution and locality-level differences)
analysed earlier (see Chapter 3.1).

# 1. Introduction & Data Source

This report examines the combined influence of genomic alterations and environmental exposures on Lung Cancer (LC) development in Northern Israel. The study integrates molecular biomarker data with spatial information to elucidate gene-environment interactions.

The dataset consists of **94 lung cancer cases** managed at the Carmel Medical Center (2024-2025). It includes 21 variables covering demographics, histopathological diagnosis, and molecular biomarkers (PD-L1, EGFR, KRAS, etc.).
